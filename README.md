The success of a team is heavily reliant on the efficiency and efficacy of its members. However, the sudden absence  of a crucial team member due to unforeseeable events like illness, resignation, or termination can have a significant  impact on team performance. Finding a competent substitute who can execute at the same level as the departing team member is crucial in such circumstances to prevent project delays or disruptions. This task can be difficult and timeconsuming for project managers and team leaders, leading to a need for an effective algorithm that can quickly and  economically suggest viable replacements for important team members. 

To address this issue, our study is inspired by the article "Replacing the Irreplaceable: Fast Algorithms for Team Member Recommendation" by Liangyue Li, Hanghang Tong, Nan Cao, Kate Ehrlich, Yu-Ru Lin and Norbou Buchler and “Finding a Team of Experts in Social Networks” by Theodoros Lappas, Kun Liu and Evimaria Terzi. Our goal is to create a recommendation system that offers the best team configurations by maximizing team strengths and minimizing shortcomings using machine learning approaches. This approach can assist coaches and team managers in making well-informed judgments about their team's make-up and tactics. Additionally, it can be applied to substitute injured or sick athletes and to select employees suited for specific jobs in business teams. To achieve this goal, we aim to develop a recommendation system for coaches and team managers to create the best team configurations based on strengths and weaknesses discovered using machine learning techniques on NBA statistics data.
